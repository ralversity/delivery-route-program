# delivery_route_program

This is a simple program that uses CSV data to load theoretical packages onto trucks according to certain
specifications on packages. It then creates an efficient route for trucks to follow using a greedy algorithm.
The program contains a direct-hashing hash map developed from scratch as well as giving the ability to look-up
packages via a package ID.
